        <ul><b>Starstruck</b>
      
             Starstruck is a movie about a girl named Jessica Olsen who took a trip from her home town in Michigan to California to visit her grandmother. While she is there, she runs into pop star Christopher Wilde. In the beginning she wants nothing to do with him and I like how she stands her ground. Throughout the movie she starts to like him a little and spends the day with him. Jessica just brings out a whole different side of Chris and I personally like this side of him better. Later when he is embarrassed to be seen with her, it makes me really mad at him; he just spent thewhole day with her like how could you do that. When Jessica is heartbroken you really feel her pain and when Chris sings “What You Mean To Me” at the end I like how she doesn’t fall for it right away; but when he talks to the reporters about how he really feels about Jessica, you begin to like him again and you know that she has changed him for the better. </ul>
