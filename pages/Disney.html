               <ul><b>Starstruck</b>
       
                 Starstruck is a movie about a girl named Jessica Olsen who took a trip from her home town in Michigan to California to visit her grandmother. While she is there, she runs into pop star Christopher Wilde. In the beginning she wants nothing to do with him and I like how she stands her ground. Throughout the movie she starts to like him a little and spends the day with him. Jessica just brings out a whole different side of Chris and I personally like this side of him better. Later when he is embarrassed to be seen with her, it makes me really mad at him; he just spent thewhole day with her like how could you do that. When Jessica is heartbroken you really feel her pain and when Chris sings “What You Mean To Me” at the end I like how she doesn’t fall for it right away; but when he talks to the reporters about how he really feels about Jessica, you begin to like him again and you know that she has changed him for the better.</ul> 
       
                <ul><b>Princess Protection Program</b>
 
                  Princess Protection Program is about two girls; Carter, who is a tomboy, and Rosie (Rosalinda) who is a princess. They end up having to live together in Louisiana, but it takes Carter some time to adjust. I understand why Carter is not the most welcoming person in this situation and that she is a bit annoyed but I like how she eventually warms up to Rosie. I think the fact that they don't get along for a while makes the ending that much better. Carter has to try to help Rosie act like a regular American teenager but it is not an easy task. There are a lot of times in this movie where it makes you laugh because of the way Rosie acts and some of the things that Carter does to sort of take advantage of her. There are also times where you feel bad for both of them but in very different ways. I love when they finally realize that they have more in common than they thought and when they start to help each other. Personally, I really like the story line and the movie as a whole. I think that Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato both do a very good job with their acting.</ul>
