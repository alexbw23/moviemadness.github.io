      <ul><b>Thor Ragnarok    </b>
         
          <p>   Thor Ragnarok is an amazing movie. It is so much better than the other Thor movies and makes it more fun. Ragnarok is a Hilarious movie and makes me so happy.  The vibe of Thor Ragnarok is just so amazing, happy, funny and great. This is everything you want out of Thor and Loki. It finishes out the story arc for Loki showing that he can be a hero and introduces the story of the Valkyrie.  Ragnarok also sets up the next Avengers movie, Infinity war.  This movie's plott is less serious than any Thor movie.  The addition of Bruce Banner in this Thor movie is a duo that we have never seen before but totally works and sets his story arc up for Infinity war.   The director Taika Waititi is so amazing and does a great job.  Not only is a great director but he also plays Korg in the movie. Korg is the comedic relief and such a great character. Taika Waititi is so funny and good, he brings a new version of Thor and I am so excited to see what else he does in the MCU. </p></ul>

           <ul><b>Captain America: First Avenger</b>
          <p> Captain America: First Avenger is a movie about the star spangled man with a plan, Steve Rogers. It is about Steveâ€™s journey in becoming the first super soldier, meeting the love of his life, losing friends and being frozen for 70 years. The American war hero who fought Nazis with his best friend Bucky Barnes and the amazing Peggy Carter.  This movie shows the value of friendship and a true hero. This movie also demonstrates how much can corrupt people and turns someone into more of what they already are.  This movie is super fun and is a great background for the next Captain America Movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

<ul><b> Guardians of the Galaxy</b> 
  
          <p> 
Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, energetic movie with great music.  The vibe is very similar to Thor Ragnarok, comedic but still has a great plot. The Guardians of the Galaxy are a group of people who meet in an intergalactic prison and how they become a family while saving the world from a power hungry crazy person with an infinity stone.  The story mainly follows peter Quill right after his mother dies and then he was abducted by a group of alien Ravagers.  He was raised with them and spends his adult life as a scraper getting jobs around the galaxy.  He meets Rocket, Groot, Gamora and Drax, Peter shares his love of music with his tand they travel the galaxy trying to stop the Kree extremist Ronan.  This movie introduces a major villain in the MCU and how he is a "puppet master" pulling all the strings to make everything go in his favor.  This movie shows how much bad a single infinity stone can do alone if in the wrong hands.  Guardians of the Galaxy is ultimately a great movie and super fun to watch.
